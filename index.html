        <div id="introduction">
            TypeScript in its most basic form is JavaScript with the ability to make variables strongly typed.
            This allows for the creation of JavaScript like applications that have more strict typing similar to what is found in C#,
            Java, etc.
        </div>

            <h3>
                TypeScript Basics
            </h3>
            <p>
                TypeScript is able to use type inference to ensure that code later on is following the same
                type for the assigned variable. An example of creating a basic string variable is shown below using the : operator
            </p>
            <div class="codeExample">
                let exampleStringVariable:string = "This is a String";<br>
                //or<br>
                let exampleStringVariable:string = 'This is a String';
            </div>
            <p>
                TypeScript also allows for inference of types at the time of initialization by usign the let keyword.
                The code below is infered to have a type of variableName:string due to being set to a string value at
                initialization.
            </p>
            <div class="codeExample">
                let variableName = "This is an inferred variable";<br>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="textBlock">
            <h3>Creating Types</h3>
            <p>
                TypeScript allows for the creation of "types" which are essentially object definitions in other
                programming lnaguages. This allows for "objects" that are more strictly defined than typical JSON
                objects. The definition of types is the same as the definition of JSON objects, an examples is 
                shown below.
            </p>
            <div class="codeExample">
                const testObject {<br>
                    &emsp;objName: "String Object Name",<br>
                    &emsp;objId: 100<br>
                }
            </div>
            <p>
                TypeScript also allows for the creation of interfaces through the interface keyword. Interfaces help
                provide warnings, but will not cause a crash if not followed.
            </p>
            <div class="codeExample">
                interface Person{<br>
                    &emsp;name: string,<br>
                    &emsp;age: number<br>
                }
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="textBlock">
            <h3>Creating Classes</h3>
            <p>
                TypeScript also allows for the creation of classes with defined tyes for constructors and methods as
                shown below in the code example from TypeScript for JavaScript Programmers
            </p>
            <div class="codeExample">
                interface User {<br>
                    &emsp;name: string;<br>
                    &emsp;id: number;<br>
                }<br>
                <br>
                class UserAccount {<br>
                    &emsp;name: string;<br>
                    &emsp;id: number;<br>
                   
                    &emsp;constructor(name: string, id: number) {<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;this.name = name;<br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;this.id = id;<br>
                    &emsp;}<br>
                }<br>
                <br> 
                const user: User = new UserAccount("Murphy", 1);
            </div>
            <p>
                Functions can also have types defined for both return and parameters for functions
            </p>
            <div class="codeExample">
                function functionWithReturn(): string { }<br>
                <br>
                function functionWithParam(name: string) { }
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="textBlock">
            <h3>Union Types</h3>
            <p>
                TypeScript allows programers to define their own "types" through the sue of the type keyword and | union operator. 
                These programmer defined types are in a lot of ways similar to defining enumaerations in C# and Java. An example of 
                a few programmer designed types are shown below.
            </p>
            <div class="codeExample">
                type booleanType = true | false;<br>
                type allowedNames = "Jane" | "John" | "Daniel" | "Beth";<br>
                type multiplesOfFourToTwenty = 0 | 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20;
            </div>
            <p>
                The union operator (|) can also be used to allow a funciton to accept multiple types as input. For example the code below would
                allow for both a string or a number to be taken as the parameter
            </p>
            <div class="codeExample">
                function stringNum(val: string | number) { }
            </div>
            <p>
                the typeof keyword is used often in TypeScript to help determine if an input variable is of the correct type. Ane example of
                checking if the type is a string is shown below
            </p>
            <div class="codeExample">
                if(typeof obj === "string") { //do something }
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="textBlock">
            <h3>Generics</h3>
            <p>
                TypeScript allowsfor creation of generic types, just like C# and Java. These generics can be used similarly to Java to help 
                create interfaces and objects. An example of a generic interface is shown below.
            </p>
            <div class="codeExample">
                interface GenericInterface &lt;Type><br>
                &emsp;add: (obj: Type) => void;<br>
                }<br><br>
                declare const genericDec: GenericInterface&lt;string><br>
                <br>
                const obj = genericDec.get(); // obj is a string due to above decleration
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="textBlock">
            <h3>Structural Typing</h3>
            <p>
                At the core of TypeScript is its structural typing system. Structural typing is based on the "shape" of a value.
                The shape can generally be thought of as two objects having the same fields being the same type of object. It is 
                better shown through the example below. Note that an interface or a class could be used interchangably in this example
            </p>
            <div class="codeExample">
                interface User { // Interface for a User Object<br>
                    &emsp;name: string;<br>
                    &emsp;id: number;<br>
                }<br>
                <br>
                // Creates a user object through structural typing<br>
                const exampleUser = { name: "Daniel", id: 1234 }<br>
                /* even though exampleUser isn't explicitly told to be a User object it will become one based on the shape */
            </div>
        </div>
